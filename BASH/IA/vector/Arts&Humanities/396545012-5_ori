	<title>Bass guitar query hmmm . ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I 'm thinking of getting a bass guitar to learn on , i dunno much about them but getting a urge to play one ????? My question is are they boring instruments , will I get bored ? Thanks .</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401655742000">Learning bass guitar will not be the same as learning guitar , and you ca n't whip out a bass at a sing along or party to entertain . I love playing guitar and like to play bass , but only in the context of playing a song with a band . I would not have liked to start on bass first . It can be a lot of fun to play , and you also are essential , but limited in what you can do , because you need to be solid and consistent with the drummer , so everyone can rely on you to keep things steady and solid . I would not do it on a whim , or because of an `` urge '' . you should only learn it if you have a passion for the bass and want to be a part of something . There are no `` solo '' bass players , really . -LRB- maybe Stanley Jordan -RRB- Thank god there are some people who do have the passion to be the anchor of a group as the bass player . Good bass players are really hard to find .</answer><suggestions>stanley/PERSON jordan/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401656687000">Bass is an ensemble instrument . Meaning it serves a specific purpose within a group . It is not exactly the type of instrument that you just sit down and play songs by yourself . -LRB- although you can -RRB- It is also very challenging to play well . Most people think it is going to be easier than the guitar but that is simply not true . It takes more physical strength and dexterity to play because the strings are bigger , the necks are longer and the nature of the instrument means you are moving your fingers constantly . Bass can be a lot of fun if you are really into it , especially if you are jamming with others . It is an essential instrument for any rock , pop , blues , metal , etc band . It forms the foundation of the music and , along with the drums , propels the rhythm of the group . I strongly urge you to take lessons so that you can learn the proper techniques and develop good habits . A good instructor can keep you motivated when you feel bored and assign material to challenge your abilities .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401827749000">No Solo Bass Players hmmmm ? I think Jaco Pastorius , Stu Hamm , Geddy Lee and John Patitucci to name just a few would have disagreed with that comment . I say if you have a desire to play one then give it a go - there are some real decent bass guitars out there for ridiculously low prices and if you have a hankering to play one I would encourage you to give it a go . And as for whipping out a bass at a party - why not ? Sorry , but I would not try and discourage you one iota for wanting to learn an instrument .

The simplest thing to say is ` do n't try and manipulate me ' cause that ultimately makes it clear it wo n't work .

Anyway , long story short , the Baudelaire siblings travel around to a hospital , a carnival , a mountain , a grotto and a hotel escaping Count Olaf , and learning about V.F.D. , which is assumed to stand for `` Volunteer Fire Department '' . In the very last book , they go on boat to an island where their parents once lived . A poisonous fungi fume is released and the inhabitants of the island escape . The Baudelaire orphans are immune to it . Count Olaf dies . At the end , they travel onto a boat to go back home . Whether they were successful is unrevealed .

	<answer epoch="1402177727000">I know you only posted because you felt unsure of yourself and needed Yahoo Answerers ' encouragement . That 's okay . But I believe , in the long term , it could become crippling . See , you 're 13 . Statistically , you 're a terrible writer . The fact that you do n't punctuate your question properly , and that you have made about 5 different kinds of grammatical mistakes , only supports this prejudice . That 's okay too . It 's okay to suck . I guarantee you do right now . Do you know how I know ? You think an `` advanced vocab '' and `` interesting descriptions of characters '' make for a good story . Writing is SO much more than that . New writers tend to make the same mistake as you do -- merely looking at qualities which you deem you are good at . Besides , everyone prefers a simple vocab . It does n't impress anyone . It does n't tell anything about the author other than that they can browse thesaurus.com . So , you suck . You suck hard . Probably much better than others of your age , but you still suck . No one will regard your book properly , no matter how well you think you 've written . I have only two words of advice : Just write . At some point , you 'll just have to accept that you suck . You ca n't eternally live off the words of encouragement from Internet strangers . So just write . Do n't give a shit that you suck . Because with enough practice , you 'll become better . Writers are made , not born . And while ordinary authors only find their passion around ~ 20 ish , you 'll have had 7 years of practice . 7 years of daily writing is a lot . By the time you 're 20 , you 'll probably be good enough to look back and say , `` Damn , I sucked . '' So just write . Practice . Read . Read everything from fantasy novels to science mags to books on writing . I 'd recommend Stephen King 's On Writing , K. M. Weiland 's Structuring Your Novel , and Roy Peter Clark 's Writing Tools : 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer . Do n't depend on what other people say .

	<answer epoch="1402188758000">Take some time , develop your skills as a writer . Find a mentor , like an English teacher or a creative writing club , someone who IS willing to read your book and give you lots of constructive criticism for it . Writing is a skill that takes a long time to develop , and good writing is more than interesting descriptions and good vocabulary , it 's a subtle art that involves character development , plot devices , good dialogue , good pacing and progression , a strong and thought provoking central theme . Do n't worry , these are skills you will learn . But remember , the first book or first draft you produce will most likely not be publishable , this is n't because you are a kid ; it 's true of ALL first time writers . In fact , even for adults who start writing , very few actually publish their first book . The trick is to keep working and keep teaching yourself how to be a good writer . You can do it , though it wo n't come right away . Here is my basic advice I give out to all first time writers . It 's a summary of the novel writing process . In summary , the writing process is this . Pick your theme or message ahead of time and base your work around that . Spend a few months planning and sketching developing plot and characters . Write a very thorough outline before you begin to draft . Draft , without being afraid to revise your outline as you draft . Revise aka re-write a lot , either after you finish your draft or as you go . Revise a lot . Do not expect the process to be creative and easy . Expect it to be hard work with very little glamor or romance . There is no such thing as inspiration . No one will reach down from heaven to give you ideas You must think of them yourself , which is hard work . There is no such thing as writer 's block . There is only writing , which is harder to do on some projects\/sections than it is to do at others . You must power through it just like you would power through a difficult school project . Pick a theme or idea that you want to share with the world . Do n't invent the story and come up with a theme later . Start with theme and base your characters on that . It can be any message . `` Love conquers all '' or `` Hate begets tragedy '' or `` the war in Iraq was a bad idea . '' You could write `` The war in Iraq was a good idea '' just as easily . Just as long as it 's something you feel strongly about , it will make a good starting focus of a novel . Then you create a character or scenario that could embody or show that story . For example if your theme was `` love conquers all '' you could show two lovers who over come impossible obstacles to stay together , or if you chose the `` War in Iraq was bad '' theme , you could write about a soldier who goes oversees and kills himself for the atrocities he sees . Design your characters and your plot to show your theme . This is the premise : The theme of the novel , and the plot and characters that show the theme . All good novels have premises , and all good writers start with a premise . Next what you have to do is a planning stage . This takes a long time . What you do first is carry a notebook . Write scenes of dialogue between two characters as soon as you imagine them . Write a general sketch outline . Start scribbling out some sketches of scene , just to get a feel of your story , world , or characters . You are not drafting your novel . Most likely nothing that goes in your sketching notebook will actually be used . It is just to help with the planning process . The next thing you need to do is create a super detailed outline . How detailed ? A three hundred page novel will have about a 20 page outline . You 'll probably have to start with a thin basic outline and then flesh it out . Planning each chapter out ahead of time is the best way to prevent what people call writer 's block . You will know where your story is going when you start drafting . This means that you will not end up writing something that makes no sense and have to scratch everything . It also means you are less likely to get stuck and end up with what people refer to as `` writer 's block '' -LRB- which I will explain in a moment is an imaginary disease -RRB- . Outlining also saves time in revisions because you can catch plot holes early . It is much easier to re-write a 20 page outline than it is to rewrite 100 pages in a novel . Some people do n't like outlining because they think it destroys the magic . Planning is not fun . Planning is not spontaneous . Planning is not `` creative . '' But it is necessary . After you finish your complete outline , then you start drafting . You do not have to start drafting from the beginning . You can start at the end or the middle , and then write in sections . Many great novels are written this way . Lord of the Rings I 've heard is an example . Do not be surprised if you start drafting and realize something you had planned in your outline is not going to work on paper . It is okay to go back and revise your outline . And although outlining does save time in revision , this is no guarantee that you wo n't have to re-write sections of your draft . Expect a draft to take about six months if you are not revising as you go and work for about an hour a day . For revision you have two options . There is the drafts methods . This is one where people write the entire draft , then go back and re-write parts they do n't like , if not re-write the whole thing . There is also the revise as you go method , where people write and revise one chapter or one section at a time . Sometimes re-writing something three our four or five times before moving on to the next section . Either method is fine . I prefer the second , because I find it easier to beak work into chunks and work on it one chunk at a time . I loose patience working in large portions or work . For all writers , a good thing to remember that 90 % of what you write is going to be total crap . For beginning writers this is about 95 % , for experienced writers this is about 80 % . The difference between good writers and bad writers is n't the ratio . The difference between good writers and bad writers is that good writers know this ratio exists , so they right something ten times to ensure that at least one draft will be a good draft . Prepare to write a lot . I have been working on my novel for a year . It is about two hundred pages long , but in total I have written over 500 pages , and that is a conservative estimate . Most of what I write never sees the light of day . I re-write constantly , and that 's okay . I have to warn you that writing is nothing like what a lot of people imagine it to be . Let me destroy your innocence now so that you will not get discouraged and give up because it was destroyed in the middle of the writing process . People imagine writing to be a spiritual experience of source . First time writers often believe they are some type of biblical prophet . They think they can go out into the desert , get `` inspiration '' from some grand source above , and spit it all out onto a page in a creative ecstatic trance . This is completely false . Writing is like a scientific experiment . It is fun and creative for the first five minutes when you are planning , but the rest of it is hard menial labor . You must plan very very carefully ahead of time , you must be super analretentive , and you must OK with the fact that the first thing you try probably is n't going to work and that you 'll have to start over and do it all again , likely having to start over several times . Many writers go in expecting to have this creative trance experience , but when the initial creative high wears off , they do n't know how to buckle down and actually get to work . They dub the death of this high `` writer 's block , '' and then they quit . This is why so many novels are aborted after the first twenty pages . People do n't know how to actually do the hard work to write the other 280 . If you feel you are running out of creative ideas or running out of inspiration , trust me , you are not running out of anything . You are just experiencing the normal feeling of being a writer . Inspiration comes from no where . `` Inspiration '' in fact , like `` writer 's block '' does not exist . You have to think of ideas yourself , which is hard work . Some parts of your novel are going to be harder to write than others . Expect to re-write some chapters five our six times . You are not experiencing writer 's block . You are experiencing writing . Plan out ahead of time , this is not a romantic process . It is a process for people who are masochistic and insane such that they enjoy hard work . Work hard . Have fun . DO NOT GIVE UP . Produce something you can be proud of . Good luck .</answer><suggestions>iraq/LOCATION iraq/LOCATION iraq/LOCATION</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403570435000">It sounds a bit like you feel like you ca n't control your own characters . They , however , do n't necessarily have to be likeable . They have to make a statement . They have to be relatable . Make them larger-than-life -- have them make decisions that you would n't do in real life . Make them relatable by creating them with flaws . Make them want something . Give them hopes , dreams , desires , quirks , fears , obstacles ...</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403571432000">To make a character likable , you have to make them interesting and unlike any normal person . That way , your reader would be tempted to read more . You have to give the character some good traits and some bad ones so that they sorta even themselves out . You can also give them some interesting hobbies , likes , dislikes - petpeaves ... etc. . Every villain has a good trait and every good guy has a bad trait . That makes everything much more fun ! Try it out .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403571584000">To make a character likeable , they need to possess traits that people admire in addition to their faults .

However , she 's also dark , pessimistic , and overly dramatic .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403572954000">You 've got some very good advice so far . Let me add this : Do n't think of them as `` characters '' . Imagine they are real people .

	<answer epoch="1403583259000">Do n't have your characters tip the scale with their traits .

Give them a background , make them more than just a person with a name tag . Maybe this guy was angry all the time because he was having family problems , or maybe he was naive because he was sheltered all his life by his mom , or maybe she 's nice to everyone because she 's trying to forget about her troubled life and the car crash that killed her parents , something like that .</answer><suggestions>david/PERSON david/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403583536000">Likeable characters are ones that are -LRB- most of the times -RRB- either relatable or entertaining . Let 's say you have an asshole character that no one in the story likes , but he has a sick but funny sense of humor -LRB- kind of like John Bender from the Breakfast Club -RRB- , then he\/she will probably be a well liked character . But in every character its important to have something in them that can be relatable to someone . If you ca n't do this , a single character that is relatable can often drag a reader in as well . A turnoff in characters is often one that has no relatable traits and\/or does not offer something to the reader . If a completely un-relatable character does not make the reader laugh , cry , or wonder , then he\/she will not be liked . It 's important to make them seem like a real person . Even if they 're the most badass character ever , giving that character at least one fear or one goal , they 've just become that more relatable .</answer><suggestions>john/PERSON bender/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403587222000">Basically , I think when it comes to writing villains , you need to write just enough to make the reader see where they are coming from , even if it is twisted logic-the reader needs to understand his motivations . An example of this is in the tv show Heroes ... a character named Sylar goes around murdering everyone by cutting their head in half , exposing their brain . Even though he is pure evil , we understand that his motivation is not random killing , but only trying to understand how other super powers work by examining their brain . Later , the writers take it a step farther by explaining that he himself is not a bad person , it 's his powers that cause this hunger for destruction . They make you think that if he just had the right person in his life to influence him , he could even be redeemable . That is my idea of the perfect villain . As far as Tyler being an asshole , you could give some hint to his backstory to explain how he got that way . Sometimes understanding that a character has had a hard life allows the reader to accept assholeness as an expected result . As far as making the heroes likeable , it helps to give them weaknesses and insecurities as well as admirable qualities . A too perfect hero is not relatable , but a too whiny hero is not worth any emotional investment .</answer><suggestions>tyler/PERSON</suggestions>

Kids dont decide to be criminals - society condemns such behavior and young people aspire to be liked , to fit in . Impoverished youth may find it necessary to perform criminal activity -LRB- such as stealing toilet paper from work for your single mom -RRB- . Or join a gang , not out of peer pressure , but to stay alive . For the well-off youth , peer pressure happens . `` Everyone else has the coach sunglasses , why cant I ?

	<answer epoch="1402047473000">People are individuals , with individual perspectives , desires and beliefs . Kids , especially , are subjected to others telling them what to do , what to want and what to believe . It stands to reason that they 're not ALL going to put up with that . Children are n't raw material to be shaped into what a society wants them to be . They 're full-blooded , card-carrying human beings . Individuals , with thoughts of their own that nobody on the whole planet can touch , just like adults . It is a testament to the human spirit that adults are n't all killed in their sleep . Crime ? It says `` You are NOT the boss of me . '' and it is right .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402049236000">Children need love and attention , they model themselves on those around them to gain this . Sometimes the models are themselves flawed so the socialisation the children receive is deviant in terms of broader society 's norms . There are families where drug taking and stealing are normal . Sometimes despite all the child 's attempts to obtain love and attention they are rejected by their parents \/ carers . They grown up hurt and distrustful , feeling that the world is their enemy . On occasion the child may suffer such trauma in a violent environment that their emotional development stops at an early age . Many of our most violent criminals suffered such trauma at age three or earlier and their emotional responses are still those appropriate to infancy . In cases where children have been involved in particularly serious crimes , including murder , there often appears to have been severe abnormalities in the family situation . As children grow they need to learn boundaries . They are still learning how to control their emotions and require external control to assist them . As Supernanny has repeatedly demonstrated even the most out of control child simply needs to be patiently kept within bounds resulting in acceptable behavior and a happier child . This applies no less to those in their teens than to younger children . Teenagers with their highly developed late childhood sense of right and wrong disrupted by new hormonal changes and strange emotions are not especially good at self-control . Loud , defiant teens can be surprisingly vulnerable and easily hurt . It is an age of natural experimentation , of learning new competencies , and of discovering how good one is at adult responsibilities . Parents to do not give their teenagers their emancipation , they have to take it step by step . Some find they have it long before they are ready . The early teens are often characterised by a rich fantasy life where their everyday weakness is transformed into one of supernatural powers . Distinguishing between the fantasy and reality is important and a rich social life keeps feet on the ground . When do children become criminal ? In fact much perfectly normal childhood behavior could be categorised as criminal . Most boys , and even some girls , have playground fights . Minor theft is common ; as is vandalism . Sexual exploration is part of normal development . Sometimes it is heavy handed adult intervention that leads a child to be labeled and start down a more serious criminal path . What is significant is that socio-economic class is so closely associated with criminality in young people . Are lower-class children innately more criminal , or is it how their behavior is dealt with i.e. by public authorities rather than by parents and school , or how limited their opportunities are to express normal adolescent restlessness within legal boundaries ? The Middle Class child with a full program of activities to which they are driven by their parents , simply lacks the opportunities for getting into trouble that a lower class child skipping school , or facing a long summer holiday without funds , finds out of sheer boredom .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402074861000">Ive worked with young offenders and let me say straight away that it doesnt matter whose at fault , blame isnt productive . Many are shaped by misfortune , circumstances which `` normal '' people would find it difficult to imagine . The best thing is to provide them with a non-threatening environment , even if only for a few hours each week . The biggest danger is competition with their peers , the need to demonstrate how cool\/hard\/bad they are and an open hostility to authority . This leads to a self perpetuating situation which leads to the negative influences from the areas you highlight . Its all too easy for them to slide down the slippery slope .

	<answer epoch="1402632621000">It sounds like something is very wrong with your instrument . Usually when low notes do n't respond on oboe , the problem can be your embouchure -LRB- or breathing or posture -RRB- , the reed , or the oboe . In a case this severe , assuming your reed is functional -LRB- does it double crow at about a C when you crow it with your lips on the thread ? Does the problem occur on multiple reeds ? -RRB- , I think the instrument is almost certainly the problem . You may have a crack , or a dead pad , or a leaking octave vent , or a badly bent key , or a badly out adjustment , or any mix of those things . I would n't be at all surprised if something is badly wrong with your first octave key or vent . You need to take your oboe to a qualified oboe repair specialist immediately . Edit : Since you 've only been playing a couple of months , it is possible that the problem is with your or with the reed . -LRB- For example , you could be accidentally leaning on the second octave key when you play -RRB- . You should consult a professional oboist -LRB- preferably your private lesson teacher , which is a thing you should definitely have on oboe -RRB- , and have them pinpoint the source of the problem . Though really , I would n't be at all surprised if it 's the oboe . If it 's a simple adjustment problem , or even possibly a leaky octave vent issue , they may also be able to fix it themselves .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
