	<title>what should I do about my bridesmaid dresses ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Okay so I went to David/PERSON 's Bridal today to look for bridesmaid dresses . I found a dress that was in the color that I like and everyone was pleased with how it looked on them . We decided go with this dress , but my friends did not want to make a purchase yet because it is still a while until my wedding and they want to have a little bit more money first to buy the dress . The women at the front desk was pressuring them to buy there dress that day . Which they ended up just walking away and still are going to purchase their dress at a later date . I get a phone call later from David/PERSON 's Bridal telling me that the dress I chose is getting discontinued so if I have my heart set on the dress , then I should go ahead and have my bridesmaids purchase the dress in the next few weeks . Do you think this sounds like they are still trying g to pressure everyone into buying the dresses or do you guys think this is truth ? I have to have everyone buy their dresses at David/PERSON 's Bridal because some of them are from different states and this is the easiest way for them to have the same dress .</content><suggestions>david/PERSON david/PERSON david/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402771236000">phone a different store and enquire dont say you have been told its being discontinued or that yo tried it on just enquire availability of the xxxxxxxxxxxx bridesmaids dresses if they push and asky why explain your cousins are coming in form out of state in a couple of months time and you saw the xxxxxxxx dress</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402771406000">No , do n't let them bully you . If it 's discontinued or not , oh well . If this one looked good , then others will too . It 's way more important for everyone to feel comfortable with spending the money closer to the actual wedding . Along the way , their weights\/body shapes may change and the dresses may be obsolete by then . Of course the retailers wants to make the sale . When looking at bridesmaid dresses , consider retailers that you would n't think of as bridal , like JC/PERSON Penney/PERSON or Avenue/ORGANIZATION , any clothing retailer . They often have formal dresses that make great bridal or bridesmaid dresses and are far more reasonable . No one would ever know you did n't get them from a bridal shop . So I must disagree that everyone buying from David/PERSON 's is the easiest way for them to have the same dress . You could select one out of a catalog website , point everyone to it and get their feedback , have them order\/alter and show up looking fabulous .</answer><suggestions>jc/PERSON penney/PERSON david/PERSON</suggestions>

	<content>This is going to sound extremely silly , but the other day I found the perfect prom dress . I was finished with all of my classes and exams and was bored so I was just looking at clothes online . I was n't planning on searching for prom dresses , but I stumbled upon sites that had prom dresses and it pretty much snowballed from there . After searching for the past few days , I fell in love with a Tony Bowls dress . I know prom is nearly a year away , but I am just extremely worried that when prom is a couple months away , the dress will be gone\/out of stock .

	<answer epoch="1403234618000">'' it 's just not growing as quickly as I 'd like it to . '' If your nails are growing , you 're also growing , so does your hair . If you 've straightened your hair in the past , STOP ! It may grow slowly or none at all . Hair that you see now is dead . Wikipedia/ORGANIZATION . But it has static electricity , when using heat , it sends currents to the roots , tampering them . Google/ORGANIZATION : `` Foods for Healthy Hair '' http:\/\/www.foodforhealthyhair.com\/ http:\/\/sg.news.yahoo.com\/food-for-health… - or 10 Best Foods for Your Hair . http:\/\/www.channelstv.com\/home\/2012\/07\/0… NO MATTER which link you picked , they all suggest the same foods . Your hair may be the fastest-growing tissue in the body but , unlike the skin , it can not repair itself . That is why getting the right balance of vitamins and proteins is imperative . Do n't expect to look like you 've stepped out of a hair commercial the day after you 've changed your diet . It is likely to take at least three months before you actually see tangible results . Hair is dead , but hair also has electrical energy ; the negative charge of damaged hair can lead to flyways and unruly hair . Growing healthy hair does n't come from a bottle or pills and hair products do not speed hair growth . Any hair oil , is another form to keep hair moisturized , nothing more . If you 're in HS/ORGANIZATION , your hair & nails should be growing normally , and as healthily as possible , since you 're eating healthy foods . But when hair is n't growing as fast , it 's because they 've been tampered with : chemicals , hair straightening , etc. . . I ALSO do not recommend using hair extensions , if you 've got thin , thinning hair , TRYING TO GROW HAIR or Afri-Amer hair texture . Traction alopecia is hair loss that occurs as a result of continuous pulling of the hair . Pulling may occur from hairstyles such as tight cornrows , plaits or braids with or without extensions , weaves , ponytails or even hair rollers or curlers . Natural hairstyles can also lead to traction alopecia as well . Long heavy locks and tightly coiled twists can lead to traction alopecia . The hair loss associated with traction alopecia typically occurs at the frontal hairline , at the temples or the area of the scalp above the ears . It may also occur at the posterior hairline.http : \/ \/ search.yahoo.com\/search?ei=utf-8&fr=aaplw&p=traction+alopecia+naomi+campbell Nearly 60 % of the women showed signs of advanced central hair loss with scarring . The women were also more likely to have type 2 diabetes and bacterial scalp infections , and sport hair styles associated with traction , including braids and weaves , the study showed . `` But hair loss is permanent , meaning that we can inject steroids or creams but it wo n't bring your hair back , so it 's very important to seek help with dermatologists early on , '' she says . Amber Rose is another example , who used to wear WEAVED styles she was a bald but beautiful model for years . BTW : her hair finally started growing again !

	<answer epoch="1403353919000">Are they 100 % human hair ? Or could they be a blend ? Blended hair will tangle and dry out easily . To figure this out take a few strands of hair from different sections of your head and burn them individually . -LRB- I know what you 're thinking , this is stupid haha -RRB- if they all turn to ash , they 're human hair . If they kind of shrivel up or melt , they 're synthetic . There 's not much you can do to tame blended hair , the synthetic hair wo n't take to treatments . But if your hair is all human , you can use small amount of argan\/Moroccan oil . If you dont have that you can use extra virgin olive oil . You put a small amount in your palm , no bigger than a dime . And work it through your hair for about 2 minutes -LRB- dry or damp -RRB- and go on styling as usual . You could also put a little more in before you go to bed , put a shower cap on , and wash as usual in the morning . Conditioning treatments work just as well but are tricky .

	<answer epoch="1402254959000">If you do n't want to be mistaken for a Satanist I 'd try wearing a cross , which is common in the goth subculture . You could wear black amongst other colors like Purple -LRB- :D -RRB- , Neon Green , Camouflage , Turquoise , White , or even Pink . There are some Goths that wear black with rainbows to add a hippie vibe . :D Good luck !</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

They are very dark brown in color -RRB- . Head and Shoulders , Selsun Blue never did ANYTHING for me . The others all worked very well , to the point where my scalp was reflecting light in the mirror . However , they are all very Drying ! I suggest you try one of them , and follow up with a very moisturizing shampoo -LRB- I use Elasta QP 's Cream lather , or SoyOil -- you can find them at Sally Beauty Supply , or any Beauty Supply Store -RRB- . I have also found that as it gets hotter -- and closer to summer , I 've started to get ` dry spots ' on my scalp , and they do n't work as well , but I have found nothing else that works better ! When I wash my hair , I do it in four sections -LRB- one at a time -RRB- , and focus directly on the scalp . Maybe you can try that technique and see if it works for you .</answer><suggestions>walmart/ORGANIZATION neutrogena/ORGANIZATION walgreen/ORGANIZATION walmart/ORGANIZATION walgreens/ORGANIZATION cvs/ORGANIZATION selsun/PERSON</suggestions>

	<title>nose ring problems ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I have had my nose ring for a year now and it healed well for awhile , then I got a bump . I went to a local piercer and they said try bactine . This worked for awhile and the infection went away . I still try to wash it occasionally and not touch it , however , it at times gets sore and sensitive . The inside skin of my nose is n't even\/level as the outside , almost as if it has a small ring around my L shaped ring . Then I noticed I have a significant amount of darker , longer , nose hair in that nostril . It is a major difference .
